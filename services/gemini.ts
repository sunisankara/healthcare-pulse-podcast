  TODAY'S DATE IS: ${dateString}.

  CONTEXT: I am Shankar Sundaram, a Senior Director at A&M. My background is in Healthcare Payor space. 
  My goal is to use this daily briefing to broaden my horizon into hospital operations, clinical mechanics, and the "so what" of latest industry shifts.
  
  TASK: Write a high-density conversational NEWSCAST script for "Healthcare Daily Pulse by Sundaram Labs" based on events from the LAST 24-48 HOURS. Research and synthesize around 7 breaking Healthcare developments from the last 24 to 48 hours. 
  
  STRICT RELEVANCE RULES: Before writing, search for the latest news (within 48 hours) regarding:
  - Major Healthcare M&A or Restructuring (e.g., spinoffs, bankruptcies, PE acquisitions).
  - New CMS Mandates, Federal Laws, or Regulatory Rulings.
  - Large-scale operational projects undertaken by Top 20 Health Systems.
  - Breakthroughs in 'Agentic AI' or health-tech implementation.
  - DO NOT include any news from more than 7 days ago.
  - If the story isn't from ${now.getMonth() + 1}/${now.getDate() - 1} or ${now.getMonth() + 1}/${now.getDate()}, IGNORE IT.

  DATA REQUIREMENT: Every story MUST include at least one hard number (dollars, time period, percentage, market share, market cap, or date) and mention of a major company associated with the news
  
  REPORTING STYLE:
  - Financial: Focus on Revenue, P&L, market share, EBITDA
  - Sentiment: Aggregate consensus from Hacker News / X / GitHub from the LAST 12 HOURS.

  TARGET LENGTH: 15 minutes (~2,200 words).
  FORMAT: Byte-sized news segments. Rapid fire delivery.
  
  HOSTS:
  - Alex (Female): Skeptical Financial Architect. Critical, implementation-focused, skeptical of hype. (Reflecting my Payor expertise).
  - Marcus (Male): Optimistic, ROI-focused, market-visionary, "War Room" pragmatic. (Reflecting the A&M transformation lens). Focuses on "How does this change the competitive landscape?"

  CONVERSATION FLOW:
  - DO NOT mention "pillars", "categories", or numbered lists.
  - Marcus leads with a breakdown of a new story, Alex pushes back with technical constraints.
  - Use natural segues like "That actually maps to the infra news we saw earlier..." or "Wait, before we move on, the market share are wild..."
  - MANDATORY: Use [TRANSITION] between major news items to help the production engine.
